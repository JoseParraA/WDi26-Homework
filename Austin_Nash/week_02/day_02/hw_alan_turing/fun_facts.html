    <p><h3>#1   His father worked for the Indian Civil Service</h3>
    Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London on June 23, 1912. The site of his birth is commemorated by a blue plaque. His father worked for the Indian Civil Service (ICS). His parents had to travel between England and India often and they left Turing and his elder brother in the care of a retired Army couple.

    <h3>#2 He showed early signs of his genius</h3>
    Turing showed remarkable ability in Mathematics and Science at an early age. At the age of 14 he could solve advanced problems without having even studied elementary calculus. Aged 16, he came across Albert Einstein’s work. Turing not only grasped his work but also extrapolated Einstein’s questioning of Newton’s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.

    <h3>#3 Alan Turing laid the central concept of modern computers</h3>
    In 1936 Turing published a paper in which he came up with the idea of the Universal Turing machine which was capable of computing anything that was computable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. In 1950 Turing proposed an experiment to find out if a machine was “intelligent”. The idea was that a computer could be said to “think” if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. The test is now called the Turing test.

    <h3>#4 Turing broke the German Enigma Code during the Second World War</h3>
    On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS). During World War II he was the principal man responsible for breaking the Enigma code used by the Germans. It is estimated that his bombe device shortened the war in Europe by two to four years. The Academy Award winning 2014 film The Imitation Game is primarily based on Alan Turing’s work at Bletchley Park.

    <h3>#5 He was known for his eccentricities</h3>
    Alan Turing had a reputation for eccentricities. During his time at Bletchley Park he used to chain his mug at work to a radiator to prevent it from being stolen. Also his bicycle had a faulty chain which came off at regular intervals. Instead of mending it, Alan used to count his pedal strokes and get off the bicycle to adjust the chain before it was due to come off.
