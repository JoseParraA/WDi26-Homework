    <p>During World War II, Turing served the Allied forces by breaking German military codes, particularly those used by the German navy. Germany's naval prowess was well known and rightfully feared. German U-boats didn't only strike terror throughout Europe, but U.S. shores were also well within the German submarines' attack range.  During the first three months of 1942, German U-boats sank more than 100 ships off the east coast of North America, in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean Sea. Many of those ships were within site of land.

Turing was in charge of Hut 8, a section at Bletchley Park (the British World War II codebreaking station) tasked with solving encoded German naval messages. He devised a range of code-breaking tools for cracking German ciphers, including an electromagnetic device called the Bombe, which countered the infamous German Enigma machine. The Enigma machine was developed in Germany shortly after World War I to encode and decode messages, and for the next 20 years the German military refined the technology until it became the Nazis' primary means of ciphering messages during WWII.  Enigma technology was continuously altered throughout the war, making the challenge of breaking German ciphers extremely difficult.</aside>
