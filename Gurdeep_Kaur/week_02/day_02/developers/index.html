  <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
  <img src="http://www.mixanitouxronou.gr/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ada.jpg" />
  <p>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace
    (Born: 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852)
    was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
    Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer,
    the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine
    had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm
     intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes
     regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and
     the first computer programmer.<a href="developers/index1.html">READ MORE</a><p>
       <h2>Ada Lovelace Day</h2>
       <p class="day">Ada Lovelace Day (ALD) is an international celebration of the achievements of women
         in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).
         It aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and, in doing so,
         create new role models who will encourage more girls into STEM careers and support women
         already working in STEM.<br><br>

Founded in 2009 by Suw Charman-Anderson, it is now held every year on the second Tuesday of October.
 It features a flagship Ada Lovelace Day Live! ‘science cabaret’ event in London, UK, at which women
  in STEM give short talks about their work or about other women who have inspired them, or perform
  short comedy or musical interludes with a STEM focus.
 This year, ALD Live will be held on 9 October, at The IET.<br> </p>
