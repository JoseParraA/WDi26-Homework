<div class="text"><h3>Education</h3>
<p>Throughout her illnesses, she continued her education. Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of
  which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age.
  She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, and Mary Somerville,
  the noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and
  logician Augustus De Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest
  in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's
  skill in mathematics could lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence".<br>

Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying differential calculus,
 she wrote to De Morgan:<br><br>

I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently
impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early
part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one
shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.<br>

Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts.
She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring "the unseen worlds around us".</p>

<div class="work"><h3>Work</h3>
  <p> Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads
    of the day, including phrenology
   and mesmerism. After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects.
    In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical
     model for how the brain gives
    rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings
    ("a calculus of the nervous system"). <br><br>She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a
    long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her 'potential' madness. As part of her research into this
    project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.
     In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism,
     but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft. In 1851, the year before
     her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning "certain productions" she was working on regarding the relation of
     maths and music.<br><br>


Portrait of Ada by British painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter (1836)
Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville.
 Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his Difference Engine.
  She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could.
  Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her "The Enchantress of Number".
   In 1843 he wrote to her:<br><br>
 Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.<br>

<div class="major"><h3>Major Work</h3>
  <p>Ada Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, known mainly for the assistance she provided
    to Charles Babbage on his ‘Differential Engine’ and ‘Analytical Engine’.
    She wrote the world’s earliest algorithm for the
    ‘Analytical Engine’, which allowed the machine to calculate 'Bernoulli numbers'.<div>
