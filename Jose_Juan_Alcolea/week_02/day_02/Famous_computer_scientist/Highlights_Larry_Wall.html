        <li>He has won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice and was the recipient
          of the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998</li>
        <li>Wall developed the Perl interpreter and language while working for System Development
           Corporation, which later became part of Unisys.[8] He is the co-author of Programming Perl
            (often referred to as the Camel Book and published by O'Reilly), which is the definitive
            resource for Perl programmers</li>
        <li>According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris
          <ul>
            <li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.</li>
            <li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</li>
            <li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.</li>
          </ul>
