        <h3>Who is Larry Wall?</h3>

        <p>Larry Wall is a computer programmer, linguist, and creator of the Perl programming language. He's from California in the United States.</p>
        <p>During graduate school, Wall studied linguistics and had plans to travel to Africa to document an unwritten languge and create a writing system for it, in part in order to be able to translate texts into that language, like the bible.</p>
        <p>These plans didn't eventuate, and Wall ended up staying in the States, but his background in linguistics is said to come through in his programming language, Perl. In the field of computer programming, he went on to write the "rn" newsreader. He also wrote the Unix program "patch" which updates text files according to instructions contained in a separate file called the patch file. It was often used by programmers to update source code. Finally, Wall went on to create the Perl programming language. Read about it <a href="perl.html">here</a>.
        <p>He's also an active member of the Church of the Nazarene, and is well-known for his wit and humour.</p>
