        <h3>What is Perl?</h3>
        <p>It's a programming language invented by Larry Wall. It's said to be a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. It became populat in the 1990s as a CGI scripting language, one of the reasons for which was its a the time unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p>
        <p>The name Perl is apparently a reference to a part of the bible.</p>
        <p>It has been said to have a lot of 'line noise' and also to be the 'duct tape of the internet' - being everywhere and being used as a glue language, and also being a bit ugly.</p>
        <p>"I'm reminded of the day my daughter came in, looked over my shoulder at some Perl 4 code, and said, 'What is that, swearing?"</p>
        <p>Larry discusses the connections between Perl and postmodernism <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html">here</a>. He claims that in both postmodernism and Perl, AND is more important than OR.</p.>
        <p>"In Perl, AND has higher precedence than OR does. There you have it. That proves Perl is a postmodern language.</p>
        <p>Every year Wall gives a State of the Onion address, on the progress of Perl and the Perl community.</p>
