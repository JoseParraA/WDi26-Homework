      <h1>Ada Lovelace: Analyst (& Metaphysician)</h1>
<p>Ada Lovelace wrote what many consider to be the first computer program before the invention of computers, a working algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.</p>

<h2>What Lovelace Saw</h2>

<p><i>"What Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation...”</i></p>
