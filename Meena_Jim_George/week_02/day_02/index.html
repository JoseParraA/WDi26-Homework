  <h1>Amazing Grace</h1>
Grace Brewster Murray Hopper <span>(December 9, 1906 â€“ January 1, 1992)</span> was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.<br><br>
She was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools.
She led to the development of COBOL.</br></br>
In 1947, her team literally "debugged" the Mark I computer, removing a moth that was stuck in the computer's relay.<br><br>
At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days).<br><br>
On November 22, 2016 Grace was posthumously awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her accomplishments in the field of computer science.<br><br>
Grace was featured in Google Doodle on 9-Dec-2013 to commemorate her 107th birthday.
