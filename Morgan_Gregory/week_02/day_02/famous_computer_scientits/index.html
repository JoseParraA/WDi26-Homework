        <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>
        <p>Hopper began her computing career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the development team that designed the <a target="-blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC I computer</a>. At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine code that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her program linker (originally called a compiler).</p>
