          Donald Knuth's parents were Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning. Donald's father Ervin was a school teacher who taught in a Lutheran school. He played a very important role in determining Donald's interests, and it was through his father that that Donald gained his love for education, music, and mathematics.

          In high school, he entered a competition set up by the confectionary manufacturer Ziegler to see how many words could be made with the letters of "Ziegler's Giant Bar". He spent two weeks pretending to be ill and, using a dictionary, he came up with 4500 words. The judges for the competition had only found 2500.

          While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, one of the early mainframes. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.

          In 1963, he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, afterwhich he joined Caltech's faculty as an associate professor.

          While working on a project to write a book on computer programming language compilers, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming.  This became The Art of Computer Programming. What was originally planned to be a single book became seen volumes.
