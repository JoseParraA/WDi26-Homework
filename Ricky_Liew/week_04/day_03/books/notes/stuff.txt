The first sign of trouble - a warning of what was to come - took the form of a young woman's body, or what was left of it, washed up on the long, white stretch of beach... A summer of terror has begun. Peter Benchley's Jaws first appeared in 1974, creating a legend that refuses to die. For a new generation, the ultimate holiday nightmare is about to begin all over again...",

    "description": "\"SQL Success\" is about problem-solving in SQL. It bridges the gap between dry and dull database theory books, and developer books that focus on giving recipes without explaining sufficiently the reasons behind the recipes or discussing alternative solutions. Many developers struggle with SQL due to the contrast between the top-down logic of most programming languages and SQL's set-based approach. \"SQL Success\" aims to be different. This book is more than syntax examples. \"SQL Success\" explains how to use SQL to solve problems, and covers syntax in the process-not as the focus, but as a tool toward accomplishing the objective. \"SQL Success\" also shows something that most other books do not: the pitfalls and traps of SQL, a deceptively simple language, and how easy it is to get a query wrong. Written in a conversational way, \"SQL Success\" talks about logic more than theory, avoids jargon, and refers to common-sense more than rules. It ignores features that are rarely used and tries to avoid information overload. The intention of \"SQL Success\" is not to cover every aspect of all variants of SQL. The goal is to cover everything that is of practical use. That goal is informed by the author's many years of practical experience leading an understanding of what professional developers need to know, the common mistakes that are made, and how those mistakes can be avoided. * Focuses on the practical implications of theory. * Emphasizes accuracy and efficiency. * Teaches how to \"think SQL\", not merely the syntax. * Applies to Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, and SQLite. * Suitable for college-level database courses, SQL certification preparation, and professionals who want to take their database skills to the next level. * Bolstered by downloadable files and online database with practice exercises at edu.konagora.com. * Includes resources for instructors.",

    "description": "Winner of 3 Oscars and the highest grossing film of its time, Jaws was a phenomenon, and this is the only book on how 26-year-old Steven Spielberg transformed Peter Benchley's best-selling novel into the classic film it became. Hired by Spielberg as a screenwriter to work with him on the set while the movie was being made, Carl Gottlieb, and actor and writer, was there throughout the production that starred Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. After filming was over, with Spielberg's cooperation, Gottlieb chronicled the extraordinary year-long adventure in The Jaws Log, which was first published in 1975, generating 17 printings and selling more than 2 million copies. This paperback edition includes an introduction by Carl Gottlieb, an introduction by Peter Benchley, and 36 black and white photos.",

If the answer is “yes” to these questions, you are a Jaws fanatic. Just When You Thought It Was Safe: A Jaws Companion by Patrick Jankiewicz splashes into the terrifying yet true stories behind the making of Jaws (1975) starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, the film director Steven Spielberg based on Peter Benchley’s 1974 runaway best selling novel of the same name. The equally stupendous success of Spielberg’s suspense film spawned a string of sequels. Author Patrick Jankiewicz fishes out the production back stories, such as how \"Smile, You sonnuva—” and “We need a bigger boat!” were created. He reels in all the shark's victims, including John Hancock, Lance Guest, and Dorothy Tristan, for exclusive interviews, and he harpoons of the sequels, Jaws 2 (1978), Jaws 3-D (1983), Jaws: The Revenge (1987). 235 pages.",
