                John von Neumann (Neumann János Lajos) was a Hungarian mathematician, born in Budapest in 1903. He died in 1957 at age 53.
            </p>
            <p>His contributions to mathematics were extensive and include founding the field of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">Game Theory</a>, establishing a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics as well as independently
                discovering what is now known as Gödel's second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">incompleteness theorem</a>, one of two theorems that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic. (Though he acknowledged that the credit for this went to Gödel for discovering it first)</p>
            <p>In computer science, one of von Neumann's most important contributions included writing a paper that described and led to the
                creation of the computer architecture that almost all modern computers are based on, known as
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>
            </p>
            <p>The other important contribution, that came about through von Neumann's rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication, was the creation of the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a> and the idea of a self-replicating machine. This set of ideas and theories have much in common with the science of DNA but preceded the discovery of DNA and its mechanisms.</p>
