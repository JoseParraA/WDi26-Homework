                John von Neumann was some sort of mathematical super being, he could instantaneously perform complex operations in his head such
                as summing geometric series. He also had a remarkable eidetic (photographic) memory and would entertain friends
                by memorising pages of a telephone directory and reciting names, addresses and numbers from randomly provided
                page numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Von Neumann worked extensively on the Manhattan project developing the atomic bomb for the United States and was heavily instrumental in brining about the state of "assured
                mutual destruction" during the cold war with Russia.
