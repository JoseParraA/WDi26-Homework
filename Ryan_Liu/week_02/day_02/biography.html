            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Born in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, he was raised in Tottori Prefecture from the age of four. According to an interview
                conducted by Japan Inc., he was a self-taught programmer until the end of high school.[3] He graduated with
                an information science degree from University of Tsukuba, where he was a member of Ikuo Nakata's research
                lab on programming languages and compilers.</p>

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>He works for the Japanese open source company, netlab.jp. Matsumoto is known as one of the open source evangelists
                in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the Emacs-based mail user agent,
                written entirely in Emacs Lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside Japan</p>

            <h2>Ruby</h2>
            <p>He works for the Japanese open source company, netlab.jp. Matsumoto is known as one of the open source evangelists
                in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the Emacs-based mail user agent,
                written entirely in Emacs Lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside Japan.[4]
                Ruby Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995.[5][6] He
                still leads the development of the language's reference implementation, MRI (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).
                MRuby In April 2012, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called mruby.[7][8]
                It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, called ritevm, and is designed to allow software
                developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimised.
                streem In December 2014, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new scripting language called streem, a concurrent
                language based on a programming model similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other functional
                programming languages.[9] Treasure Data Matsumoto has been listed as an investor for Treasure Data; many
                of the company's programs such as Fluentd use Ruby as their primary language</p>
