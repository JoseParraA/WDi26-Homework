            <h2>More about Matz</h2>
            <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />
            <p class="read-more-wrap">I am from Yonago City in Tottori Prefecture in Japan. Yonago City does not have a large population, but it is
                a beautiful area blessed with both the ocean and mountains. I became interested in programming when I was
                a middle school student, and since studying Computer Science at Tsukuba University I have been working as
                a programmer.
                <span class="read-more-target">Since 1993 I have been designing and developing the open source Ruby programming language. Ruby has now become
                    a very popular programming language around the world, and it is widely used in many fields including
                    the Web. Since 1997 I have been living in Matsue City in Shimane Prefecture, which isn’t too far from
                    where I grew up. It is also a beautiful city. I have a wife and 4 children. My two eldest daughters are
                    currently attending school in Tokyo, and the youngest two—a son and a daughter—live at home with us</span>

            <h2>WHY I AM A MORMON</h2>
            <p>The first catalyst for coming to know about the church and the gospel was when my parents were converted while
                I was still a young child. I think it was a major challenge for my parents to become Christians in this non-Christian
                country of Japan. After that I was brought up in the gospel, but I then went to college and started living
                on my own. But when I prayed with real intent about my own faith, I realized that I already had faith in
                Jesus Christ. And I then served as a full-time missionary so that I could tell others about this.

                <article>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Started programming in 1980</li>
                        <li>Met Emacs for the first time in 1988 on A Sun-3</li>
                        <img src="img/sun3.jpg" alt="sun3" width=640>
                        <li>Emacs was prohibited back then because it consumes too much memory</li>
                        <li>Emacs was his first Lisp interpreter</li>
                        <li>Got a Sun-4 (Spark station) in 1989 and started using Emacs</li>
                        <li>Didn't want to write anything without Emacs, so eventually he wrote an email client called "CMail"
                            in Emacs lisp.</li>
                        <li>Started the development of Ruby in 1993 with influence from Emacs implementation</li>
