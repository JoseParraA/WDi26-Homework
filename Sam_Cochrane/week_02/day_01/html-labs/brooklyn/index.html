  <p> Brewed with hand-smoked malt from red and white oak from a forest in Orange County, VA, on land once owned by James Madison. Hazy, slightly muddy brown with orange and copper hues around the edges. Beige head with some initial foam, but it quickly settles to a thin wisp. Raw and wheaty aroma with a hint of smoked malts and a faint suggestion of cocoa powder. Otherwise, pretty clean in the nose. Watery and very light in the mouth. Thin caramel and toasty malt character, with a bread crust linger and soft chocolaty edge.<br><br> Carbonation livens the palate up with a zest that pulls with it a slight citric bitterness and banana-like pithiness that sits among the wheat and rye flavors. Tangy rye with some spice and smoky malt character rounds off the brew, with a lingering, bittersweet, toasty bread finish in tote. Mouth is left dry and a bit sour. Wasn't working for us at first, but once the beer warmed, the flavors began to emerge. We can imagine that this is as close as one could probably get using modern-day brewing equipment and methods. Most appealing brew of the pack.
