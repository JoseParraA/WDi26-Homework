//Find index number in array of start and finish

// loop through array tripStart's array starting at tripStart's index until it hits tripEnd OR Union Square. Add + 1 to variable noOfStops with every stop. When it hits Union Square, if Union Square is tripEnd stop loop. Convert array name to lineName. (ie. N nth to N)
// Console log "You must travel through the following stops on the ${ lineName } line: ${ stops }". Console log "Change at Union Square."

// If Union Square is NOT tripEnd, go to tripEnd's array starting at UnionSquare's index (-1) and loop through backwards. Add + 1 to variable noOfStops with every stop. When it hits tripEnd stop loop. Convert array name to lineName. (ie. N nth to N)
// If continuing on same line Console log "You must travel through the following stops on the ${ lineName } line: ${ stops }". Else console log "Your journey continues through the following stops: ${ stops }."

// console log ""${ noOfStops } in total"
//







// console.log() shows output similar to this:
// "You must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."
// "Change at Union Square."
// "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// "7 stops in total."
