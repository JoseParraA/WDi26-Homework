        <h2>Who the heck is he?</h2>
        <p>Herbert Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian professor, philosopher, and public intellectual. His work is one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. </p><p>Born in Edmonton, Alberta, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.</p>

      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why is he such a badass?</h2>
        <p>McLuhan is known for coining the expression "the medium is the message" and the term global village, and for predicting the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented!</p>

        <h3>"The medium is the message"</h3>
        <p>a phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan meaning that the form of a medium embeds itself in any message it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="infobox village">
        <h3>"Global Village"</h3>
        <p>a metaphoric shrinking of the world into a village through the use of electronic media. Global village is also a term to express the constituting relationship between economics and other social sciences throughout the world.</p>

      <div class="infobox www">
        <h3>Predicting the WWW</h3>
        <p>Though the World Wide Web was invented almost thirty years after The Gutenberg Galaxy, and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:</p>

        <p>The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.</p>
