        <img src="img/young_rich.jpeg">
        <p>Richard Matthew Stall, more commonly known as RMS, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed "free software".</p>

      <p>Stallman launched the GNU project in 1983 to create a UNIX-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software. He also pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify and distribute free software and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL).
